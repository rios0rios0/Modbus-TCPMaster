# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This file is not edited by hand. Every change writes its own fragment under
`.changes/unreleased/` with [chlog](https://github.com/luizjhonata/chlog), and a release compiles
the pending fragments into a version section here — so two branches each adding an entry no
longer touch the same lines, and a rebase that used to conflict on this file now conflicts on
nothing.

When a new release is proposed:

1. Create a new branch `bump/x.x.x` (this isn't a long-lived branch!!!);
2. The fragments pending under `.changes/unreleased/` are compiled into a version section by `chlog batch auto && chlog merge` (AutoBump does this for you — it reads the fragments directly);
3. Open a Pull Request with the bump version changes targeting the `main` branch;
4. When the Pull Request is merged, a new Git tag must be created using <LINK TO THE PLATFORM TO OPEN THE PULL REQUEST>.

Releases to productive environments should run from a tagged version.
Exceptions are acceptable depending on the circumstances (critical bug fixes that can be cherry-picked, etc.).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.1] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- changed both `chlog new` examples in the AI-assistant instruction block of `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to `--body '<past-tense description>'`: changelog bodies here are written in simple past tense, and the body is single-quoted because it carries backticks that a double-quoted shell argument would command-substitute, and added the line telling the reader to write an apostrophe inside the single-quoted body as `'\''`, since bodies here carry possessives, and switched the one other hand-written `chlog new` example in `.github/skills/code-review/SKILL.md` to the same single-quoted body argument
- re-wrapped the secret-hygiene bullet of the `code-review` skill to the fleet-standard five-line form the weekly refresh prescribes, without changing a word of it
- refreshed `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `.github/skills/code-review/SKILL.md` to document the `checks.yaml` PR gate and fix the secret-hygiene fixture guidance

### Fixed

- regenerated 1 hand-written changelog fragment with `chlog new`, keeping its kind and body, so the filename prefix and the `time` field come from chlog's own clock like every other fragment's

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- added the `checks` workflow, so pull requests here run the shared `code-check > quality:basic-checks` gate (rebase status and the changelog rule) that every repository with a language pipeline already gets as that pipeline's first job. This repository has no build to attach it to, so it had no changelog enforcement at all — which is how the weekly configuration and documentation refresh hand-edited a generated `CHANGELOG.md` across the fleet before anything objected

## [0.4.1] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- refreshed `.github/copilot-instructions.md` so its repository-structure diagram lists `CLAUDE.md`, the `code-review` skill, the `.changes/` chlog directory, and the `claude-review.yaml` / `claude-mention.yaml` workflows, and its CI section documents the Claude review and mention workflows

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- added the Claude automated code review and `@claude` mention responder workflows, `claude-review.yaml` and `claude-mention.yaml`, matching the `reusable-claude-review.yaml` / `reusable-claude-mention.yaml` definitions they call in `rios0rios0/pipelines`, authenticating with the `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret

### Fixed

- restored the `.changes/unreleased/` directory with a `.gitkeep`, so the release tooling keeps recognising this project as [chlog](https://github.com/luizjhonata/chlog)-based after a release consumes the last fragment. Git tracks files rather than directories, so the bump commit that removed the final fragment removed the directory too, and the next run read the empty `[Unreleased]` section as "nothing to release"
- restored the `id-token: write` permission on both Claude workflow callers. Without it the caller grants less than the reusable workflow declares, which GitHub rejects before the job starts -- runs ended in `startup_failure`. The action needs the scope because `setupGitHubToken()` exchanges a GitHub OIDC token for the GitHub App token it posts with, unless a `github_token` is passed explicitly.

### Removed

- removed the unused `id-token: write` permission from the Claude workflow callers, and changed `claude-review.yaml`'s display name to `Claude Review` so it matches its file name and its `Claude Mention` sibling. `anthropics/claude-code-action` needs `id-token: write` only for workload identity federation or the Bedrock / Vertex / Foundry OIDC paths; these authenticate with `claude_code_oauth_token`, so the scope allowed minting OIDC tokens for any audience without ever being used.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- added a tailored `code-review` skill under `.github/skills/` so GitHub Copilot reviews changes against the [rios0rios0/guide](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki) standards and this repository's own load-bearing invariants

### Changed

- changed the changelog to [chlog](https://github.com/luizjhonata/chlog) fragments: a change now writes its own YAML file under `.changes/unreleased/` through `chlog new --kind <Kind> --body "..."`, and `CHANGELOG.md` is GENERATED from them at release time by `chlog batch auto && chlog merge`. That is the one thing a single shared file cannot do — two branches each adding an entry no longer touch the same lines, so a rebase that used to conflict on `CHANGELOG.md` now conflicts on nothing. The `[Unreleased]` section was empty, so nothing had to be carried across. AutoBump already reads the fragments directly, so the release flow is unchanged.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- added `CLAUDE.md` with build commands, type-alias conventions, and architecture guidance for Claude Code sessions

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-19

### Changed

- refreshed `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to add `release.yaml` to the repository structure and document the CI/release pipeline

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- refreshed `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to add `CHANGELOG.md` and `.gitignore` to the repository structure and correct tracked-file annotations

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-24

The changes weren't tracked until this version.
